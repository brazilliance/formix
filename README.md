# FormIX

FormIX is an open source PHP toolkit that uses JSON Schema documents for a number of common development, deployment and maintenance tasks.

Conceptually, FormIX is intended to provide tools for building, managing and deploying the following:

- Views — render HTML Forms from a JSON Schema document.
- Migrations – manage database Migrations with a JSON Schema document.
- Models – generate scaffolding code for Models from a JSON Schema document.
- Validations – validate Models and other data objects with a JSON Schema document.
